A Google Chrome Etymology Extension
## Install
[Google Chrome WebStore Page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/etty/imlflbkfmadjonkljeijjagkhmcfobef?hl=en&pli=1)
## Usage
The extension's operation is, hopefully, fairly intuitive. It adds a context menu option upon right-clicking a word on Google Chrome webpages.

It also adds an extension popup to the Extension bar.

The context menu search opens a new tab, while the popup search offers abbreviated origins and definitions, with a link to further reading. All etymology is harvested from [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com).
